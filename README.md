# Hack Night Projects

Hey everyone! This is a collection of projects from [Hack Club's](https://hackclub.com/) Hack Nights! As more and more projects get added I will update this readme with project descriptions.

####Hack #1: Slack illuminati emoji
#####Created April 15th, 5:00 PM - 5:30 PM PDT
Created for Hack Night Stupid Edition, this is an emoji I created from an image of the "illuminati triangle", or the all-seeing eye. I sourced the original image from Google Images and I used Gimp to edit it down to a PNG of reasonable size. Then I uploaded it to Hack Club's Slack. It has already become quite popular!

####Hack #2: Mascot Generator
#####Created April 25th, 5:30 PM - 12:00 AM PDT
Another project from Hack Night Stupid Edition, this is a simple web app that randomly generates a mascot every time the page is loaded. The app randomly chooses a name, animal, hobby, food, and color. The background is a high resolution photo of sliced bread because why not. Built using the Cloud9 IDE. Overall I'm pretty glad with how this first build turned out after such a short period of work and I'm not encountering any real bugs. I plan to continue to work on it and add new features. Thanks to my friends and the people of Hack Club for giving me hilariously stupid ideas for names/hobbies/colors! **TODO:** Make the text "Reload the page to get a new mascot!" a button that actually refreshes the page. Add more relevant graphics.
